        <h1>Genevieve Johnson</h1>
        <h2>graphic designer, UX researcher, artist</h2>
        <p>Hello, thanks for your interest! I’m a Los Angeles-based graphic design student concentrating in user experience at Santa Monica College. I’m determined to use my passion for graphic design and intuitive interactions to leave the world better than I found it. </p>

        <p>I mainly stick to pencil, paper, paint, and the Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop) for design work, and I branch out to a few other tools (Invision and Balsamiq, among others) for user testing. Transparency is key – I make an effort to clearly communicate messages in my work through bold typography and thoughtful colors. I’m particularly proud of work from the summer of 2018, when I interned as a graphic designer at a nonprofit called 826LA. I created book covers, a wholesale catalog, email banners, and posters to help programmers instill kids with writing skills and confidence.</p>
          
        <p>Although most of my experience is in graphic design, I’ve conducted academic user research projects as well. Learning about people’s design opinions never fails to fascinate me.</p>  

        <p>If you have a project in mind, big or small, or you’d just like to say hello, don’t hesitate to reach out! My email is genevievej77[at]gmail[dot]com, my phone number is 310-388-739eight, and you can find me on LinkedIn @ghjohnson.</p>
