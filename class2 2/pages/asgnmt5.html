           <h1>James & the Giant Peach</h1>
           <h2>a novel by Roald Dahl</h2>
           <p>Here is James Henry Trotter when he was about four years old.
                Up until this time, he had had a happy life, living peacefully with his mother and father in a beautiful house
                beside the sea. There were always plenty of other children for him to play with, and there was the sandy beach for him to
                run about on, and the ocean to paddle in. It was the perfect life for a small boy. </p>
            <p>Then, one day, James's mother and father went to London to do some shopping, and there a
                terrible thing happened. Both of them suddenly got eaten up (in full daylight, mind you, and on a
                crowded street) by an enormous angry rhinoceros which had escaped from the London Zoo.</p>
            <p>Now this, as you can well imagine, was a rather nasty experience for two such gentle parents. But
                in the long run it was far nastier for James than it was for them. Their troubles were all over in a jiffy.
                They were dead and gone in thirty-five seconds flat. Poor James, on the other hand, was still very much
                alive, and all at once he found himself alone and frightened in a vast unfriendly world. The lovely
                house by the seaside had to be sold immediately, and the little boy, carrying nothing but a small
                suitcase containing a pair of pajamas and a toothbrush, was sent away to live with his two aunts.</p>
            <p>Their names were Aunt Sponge and Aunt Spiker, and I am sorry to say that they were both really
                horrible people. They were selfish and lazy and cruel, and right from the beginning they started beating
                poor James for almost no reason at all. They never called him by his real name, but always referred to
                him as "you disgusting little beast" or "you filthy nuisance" or "you miserable creature," and they
                certainly never gave him any toys to play with or any picture books to look at. His room was as bare as
                a prison cell.</p>
